# Barebones React/TypeScript/Express/Sass Boilerplate
This project is a starting point for a TypeScript based React app that also has a local API server using express.

There are 2 different Webpack configurations. One for the server and one for the client.

## Server
The server build process compiles the TypeScript files found in `/src/server` into a single bundled JavaScript file located in the `/dist` directory.

## Client
The client build process compiles the React app located in `/src/client` into a bundled located at `/public/js/app.js`.

The client configuration will also build the Sass files found at `/src/client/scss`. The `index.tsx` imports the `app.scss` file which already includes an import for Bootstrap.

## Running the project
In order to run the server, use `npm run dev`, and the server will start on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). 

Webpack will watch the files. Once you save a file, you can refresh your browser to ensure you got the updated client files. If you only change server files, you *shouldn't* need to refresh.

TypeScript Chirper
The purpose of this lab is to build your "half stack" (frontend, server backend, but no database yet!) Chirper lab. You'll use a React TypeScript frontend with an Express TypeScript backend. The backend will be utilizing chirpsstore.js from the Express API Lab along with your route logic.

Steps
Initial Setup and API
Use the barebones template to get started
Use chirpsstore.js from the Express API Lab. You can leave it as a .js file or convert it to .ts if you wish
Copy over or rewrite the same chirps.js route logic from the Express API Lab to:
GET all chirps
GET one chirp
POST add a new chirp
PUT edit a chirp
DELETE delete a chirp
Note: Convert this to a .ts file and update your require() syntax to import/export if you copy your code over
Make sure all route endpoints work in Postman
Frontend
Create a React frontend that uses App.tsx as your main routing component, where your BrowserRouter and Switch should be located
Your Chirper app should show a list of all chirps on the home screen
Your app should have a page with a form to POST new chirps with using an onClick handler on a button element
Each chirp in the list should have a button, Admin Options, that will go to a page that specializes in displaying a single chirp
On the page for a single chirp, you should make a GET request for the specific chirp. Display the chirp information on the page in a pre-filled form (see demo at the bottom of this lab if you're confused). Have a Delete button on the page that will trigger a DELETE request to the API for that chirp. Send the user back to the main page when the chirp is successfully deleted. You should also have an Save Edit button that will trigger a PUT request to the API for that chirp. This should also send the user back to the main page when the chirp is successfully edited
Hints
Use the Fetch API in your front-end code for making all your API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
See MDN, specifically "Uploading JSON Data" in the "Making Fetch Requests" section
Make sure to use RouteComponentProps from react-router-dom as a generic type in order to access the history and match props on your components that are routed to
You will find frontend route params and this.props.match.params to be useful in this lab
Recommended frontend paths are as follows:
/ for the main page that displays the list of chirps and a form
/chirp/:id/admin for the page that displays a chirp edit form
/chirp/add for the page to add a new chirp
Any component that is presented by the Router (e.g. your "pages") will have access to this.props.history. This is necessary to kick off navigation from your code. (in response to something being completed, etc.)
this.props.history.push('/something') allows you to navigate to the page that responds to the path /something
this.props.history.replace('/something') can be used to navigate to that path, but not keep a record of where we currently are (we are replacing the current browser history entry, with this new page we are going to. This is useful if we don't want someone to be able to click the back button and return to this page)
this.props.history.goBack() can be used to navigate back one page in the browser history
